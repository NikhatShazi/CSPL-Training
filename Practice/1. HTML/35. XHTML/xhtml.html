    <h1>   What is XHTML</h1>
<h3>XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language. It is a cross between HTML and XML language.</h3>
<p>XHTML is almost identical to HTML but it is stricter than HTML. XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application. It is supported by all major browsers.</p>

<p>Although XHTML is almost the same as HTML but It is more important to create your code correctly, because XHTML is stricter than HTML in syntax and case sensitivity. XHTML documents are well-formed and parsed using standard XML parsers, unlike HTML, which requires a lenient HTML-specific parser.</p>
