   <p><b>HTTP </b> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.<br>
       <b><span style="color:blue">HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.</span></b><br><br>
Example: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. <br>
The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.</p>
